# Mod-3-HW
# <Password Generator>

## Description

This is a password generator that requires the user to define their password length and it allows the user to define what type of characters to include in their password. This password randomly generates based off of the length & elements selected by the user. 

This password generator solves the problem of having to randomly generate passowrds. It generates randomly each time based on the user inputs. 

Lessons Learned:
- I learned how to use a function, how to use alerts, how to use prompts, how to use confirmations. 
- I also learned how to randomly generate a number based off an array's length.

## Usage

Use this application to generate a random password. To start the password generator, select the blue generate password button.

It will only generate passwords must be between 8-128 characters. 
Once the user inputs the desired length, they must select the type(s) of characters to include in the password. 
The user must select at least one of the following: uppercase characters, lowercase characters, special characters, or numbers.
